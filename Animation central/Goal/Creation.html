	<p>The website currently looked at called Animation central <br />is a stepping stone of what would inspire young people or older people to try animations and test their limits. <br />It even though it is an incomplete pile of codes it is a head start putting my work out their for people to see and i could puff out my chest and say hey, i did that!</p>
	<p>The coding processing was very slow but i was able to do most of the work by reviewing in my textbook and experimenting. <br />
	I've notice that in order to have propery label design a website it take tons of reviewing. <br />And assets you either have to create yourself or use off the internet carefully.<br />What I was originally going for was the pictures linked to the extention of the website to animations and whatever closest too can fit in the 3 as extra categories. <br />
	Art would be in one seperate category as well on the main page.
	I may have read more in the text book then I wanted to but hey who didn't?</p>

	<p>I had to resize and find pictures that actually looked like or related to the 4 animation processes knowned.</p>
